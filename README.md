# React useEffect Infinite Loop Bug

This repository demonstrates a common error in React's `useEffect` hook: an infinite loop caused by incorrect dependency management.  The example shows how a missing or incorrectly specified dependency array leads to the effect running repeatedly, causing performance issues and potentially crashes.

The solution demonstrates the proper way to use the dependency array to prevent infinite loops and improve performance.
